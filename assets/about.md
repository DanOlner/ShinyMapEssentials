# Welcome!

This website is dedicated to collating and disseminating research on 'social frontiers', particularly outputs from the three-year  2020-2023 'Life at the Frontier' project (funded by [Nordforsk](https://www.nordforsk.org/) and the [Economic and Social Research Council](https://esrc.ukri.org/)). 

Our aim is to understand the role of  'social frontiers' in determining the social mobility and integration of migrants and other groups.  Social frontiers arise when neighbouring communities are very different in terms of their cultural, ethnic and/or social make-up, and when the spatial transition in these characteristics is abrupt, rather than gradual. Recent research finds that social frontiers are associated with higher levels of anxiety, depression and crime. 

Our concern is that social frontiers also impede education and employment outcomes, leading to lower social mobility. 

Our pioneering programme of research will examine the impact of social frontiers on social mobility and their implications for integration using a combination of detailed qualitative research and pioneering quantitative methods.

Feel free to explore the data tabs to see the location of frontiers and segregation statistics for each region in England and Wales.
